= Kotlin Finite-state machine

This is a small implementation of an FSM in Kotlin.
This model supports events that trigger may cause a transition from one state to another while performing an optional action.

Assume we and to manage the state on a simple lock.
We want to ensure that the `lock()` function is only called when the lock is not locked and we want `unlock()` to be called when locked.

Then we use the DSL to declare a definition of a statemachine matching the diagram:

```kotlin
class Turnstile(var locked: Boolean = true) {
    fun unlock() {
        assert(locked) { "Cannot unlock when not locked" }
        println("Unlock")
        locked = false
    }

    fun lock() {
        assert(!locked) { "Cannot lock when locked" }
        println("Lock")
        locked = true
    }

    fun alarm() {
        println("Alarm")
    }

    fun returnCoin() {
        println("Return coin")
    }
    override fun toString(): String {
        return "Turnstile(locked=$locked)"
    }
}
```
We declare 2 enums, one for the possible states and one for the possible events.

```kotlin
enum class TurnstileStates {
    LOCKED,
    UNLOCKED
}

enum class TurnstileEvents {
    COIN,
    PASS
}
```

```kotlin
class TurnstileFSM(turnstile: Turnstile) {
    companion object {
        private fun define() = stateMachine(TurnstileStates::class, TurnstileEvents::class, Turnstile::class) {
            initial { if (locked) TurnstileStates.LOCKED else TurnstileStates.UNLOCKED }
            default {
                entry { startState, endState, _ ->
                    println("entering:$startState -> $endState for $this")
                }
                action { state, event, _ ->
                    println("Default action for state($state) -> on($event) for $this")
                    alarm()
                }
                exit { startState, endState, _ ->
                    println("exiting:$startState -> $endState for $this")
                }
            }
            state(TurnstileStates.LOCKED) {
                on(TurnstileEvents.COIN to TurnstileStates.UNLOCKED) {
                    unlock()
                }
            }
            state(TurnstileStates.UNLOCKED) {
                on(TurnstileEvents.COIN) {
                    returnCoin()
                }
                on(TurnstileEvents.PASS to TurnstileStates.LOCKED) {
                    lock()
                }
            }
        }.build()

        private val definition by lazy { define() }
    }

    private val fsm = definition.create(turnstile)

    fun coin() = fsm.sendEvent(TurnstileEvents.COIN)
    fun pass() = fsm.sendEvent(TurnstileEvents.PASS)
}
```

With this We are saying:
When the state is `LOCKED` and on a `COIN` event then transition to `UNLOCKED` and execute the code in the lambda `{ ts, _ -> ts.unlock() }`

When the state is `LOCKED` and on `event(PASS)` we are perform the action `alarm()` without changing the end state.

Then we instantiate the FSM and provide a context to operate on:

```kotlin
val turnstile = Turnstile()
val fsm = TurnstileFSM(turnstile)
```
Now we have a context that is independent of the FSM.

Sending events may invoke actions:
```kotlin
// State state is LOCKED
fsm.coin()
// Expect unlock action end state is UNLOCKED
fsm.pass()
// Expect lock() action and end state is LOCKED
fsm.pass()
// Expect alarm() action and end state is LOCKED
fsm.coin()
// Expect unlock() and end state is UNLOCKED
fsm.coin()
// Expect returnCoin() and end state is UNLOCKED
```
