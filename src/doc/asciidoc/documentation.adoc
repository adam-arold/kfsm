== Operation
The finite state machine follows a specific set of rules. This section describes the decision making and order of execution.

The state machine will receive events constrained by set of events.

The state machine will define one or more state maps each representing a subset of possible states of the same type.

The state machine will apply actions to a context. The context represents the work that need to be performed.

An event may have arguments.

Transitions defines actions to apply when the state machine is in a specific state and receives a specific event.

Guarded transitions has a guard expression that can be evaluated to allow execution of transition.

Automatic transitions are associated with states and have no events. Automatic transitions will be executed if they apply after the exit action.

For this implementation the events must be an `enum class` the state can be any type but we have been using `enum class` as well.

image::statemachine_sequence.png[FSM sequence]

When sendEvent is called the state machine applies the event to the current state map.
The current state map is usually top-level state map unless you have defined named maps and used push transitions.

=== Send Event
The normal operation is to invoke the following actions:

* sendEvent
** if(external) exitAction
** action
** if(external) entryAction

The exit action is chosen from  `stateMap/state/exit` or `stateMap/state/default/exit` or `stateMap/default/exit`
The action is chosen from `stateMap/state/transition` or `stateMap/state/default/action` or `stateMap/default/action`
The entry action is chosen from  `stateMap/state/entry` or `stateMap/state/default/entry` or `stateMap/default/entry`

The combination of current state and event determines a set of transition rules that have been applied to that combination by one or more definitions.
If the transition rules contains guard transitions the guard expressions are evaluated until one evaluates `true`.
The `entry` and `exit` action are only invoked for `external` transitions.
External transitions have an explicit target state defined. If the target state is not defined it is an internal transition.

The currentState determines the `exit` action. The target state determines the `entry` action.

=== Named Maps and Push / Pop Transitions

A named map represents a set of states that is grouped together. Named maps can be visited by using a push transition and return using a pop transition.
A push transition requires a map name and a target state along with the normal event and optional guard and action.
The current state map will be pushed on a stack and a statemap instance will be created using the named definition.
Events will be processed according to the transition rules of the named map.

== DSL
The DSL provides a way of configuring the statemachine.
The statemachine supports:

* Transitions: internal and external
* Guard expressions
* Entry and exit actions per state and globally
* Default actions per state and globally
* Named statemaps
* Push and pop transitions
* Automatic transitions

All configuration calls are eventually applied to link:javadoc/kfsm/io.jumpco.open.kfsm/-state-machine-builder/index.html[StateMachineBuilder]

=== `stateMachine {}`
The top level element is `stateMachine` either by using the function

This defines a transition when a specific event is receive and no other transition was matched.
There are 2 variations, the first is internal and doesn't define a target state, the second is external and defines a target state.
In both cases the lambda type is `C.(Array<out Any) -> Unit`

Example:
[source,kotlin]
----
transition(Event.EVENT) { args -> // default internal state action for given event
    someFunction()
}

transition(Event.EVENT to State.STATE) { args-> // default external state action for given event

Example:
[source,kotlin]
----

    mutableListOf<StateMapItem<PayingTurnstileStates>>().apply {
        if (locked) {
            this.add(PayingTurnstileStates.LOCKED to "default")

* Handler: link:javadoc/kfsm/io.jumpco.open.kfsm/-dsl-state-map-event-handler/automatic-pop.html[DslStateMachineDefaultEventHandler::automaticPop]
* Mandatory: _Optional_
* Cardinality: _Multiple_

There are 6 variations of automatic transitions: Those with and without guards, those with and without targetMaps which will lead to a new push transition.

==== automaticPush(targetMap: String, targetState: S [, guard:{}]) {}
* Handler: link:javadoc/kfsm/io.jumpco.open.kfsm/-dsl-state-map-event-handler/automatic-push.html[DslStateMachineDefaultEventHandler::automaticPush]

* Mandatory: _Optional_
* Cardinality: _Multiple_

There are 6 variations of popTransitions to provide for with and without guards, with and without a new state and with and without a targetMap that will result in a new push transition.

* Handler: link:javadoc/kfsm/io.jumpco.open.kfsm/-dsl-state-map-event-handler/transition.html[DslStateMachineEventHandler::transition]
* Mandatory: _Optional_
* Cardinality: _Multiple_

There are 4 variations of transitions: External and internal, with and without a guard expression.

This defines a transition action for a given event.
For an external transition a target state must be provided, while an internal transition must have no targetState.
An optional guard expression can be provided. The order in which the DSL encounters guard expression determine the evaluation order.
The first matching guard expression will determine the transition that will be used.
Their may be only one transition without a guard expression.

Examples:
[source,kotlin]
----
transition(Event.EV1, guard = { flag == 1 }) { args -> // internal transition with guard expression
}
transition(Event.EV1 to State.S2, guard = { flag == 2}) { args -> // external transition with guard expression
}
transition(Event.EV1) { args -> // internal transition
}
transition(Event.EV2 to State.S2) { args -> // external transition
}
